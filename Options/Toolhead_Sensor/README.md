# Enraged Rabbit Toolhead Sensor Options
ERCFv2 highly recommends a toolhead sensor if you can fit one to your toolhead. This folder contains standalone sensor options for popular toolheads.

> [!NOTE]  
> If you are using the ERF filament cutter then you should use the toolhead modification found in that folder. These lack cutting ability.
